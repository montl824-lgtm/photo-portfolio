        Hi! I’m Julia — a 21-year-old photographer living in Bristol and studying at the
        University of West England. I was born in São Paulo, moved to the U.S. when I was five,
        and grew up in Richmond, Virginia. I’m majoring in fashion communications and photography,
        but I’m always experimenting with other creative hobbies like collaging, scrapbooking,
        sewing, and hunting for vintage clothes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of my biggest inspirations are Michel Gondry and Clarice Lispector, and I love
        finding ways to blend those influences into my work. I’m always looking to meet new
        people in the field and take on new clients — if you’re interested, feel free to reach
        out via my email or Instagram linked on the contact page!
